# RSG-Watch
RSG-Watch is a project that tries to capture changes to Rockstars Servers and generally tries to find what has been changed.

## Cloud
I, alone as I have no friends, try to mirror the cloud files in the best way possible, certain files that are stored encrypted, will be decrypted, howver not all of them will be as we haven't gotten around to getting all decryption keys yet.  
However, the following files will be decrypted:
- 0x1a098062.json (used to be called tunables.json)

## SocialClub
Currently we do not monitor socialclub changes, however those will be added soon enough.
